# Prototype Starter

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

A simple boilerplate for prototyping in the browser or kickstarting small projects when no CLI for scaffolding is available ðŸš€

- [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev) for bundling
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com) for interactivity
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org) + [Standard Style](https://standardjs.com) + [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for formatting and avoiding annoying mistakes

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder. Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like [@snowpack/plugin-webpack](https://github.com/snowpackjs/snowpack/tree/main/plugins/plugin-webpack) or [snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle](https://github.com/ParamagicDev/snowpack-plugin-rollup-bundle) to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
